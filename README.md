# QOL functions that work off eachother
 not exactly sure of its purpose though qol functions and files, only doing c++ for now.


My thoughts:

Smaller files and More files = More to learn

making 1 big project gives a reason to keep going back

everyone should code its the future, the files you create will outlive you (if implemented right)
